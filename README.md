## Introduction
MSDataCurator is a Python-based toolsuite to hande MS and MSÂ² data sets from public repositories and connects them to a database search routine.
The workflow contains utility classes, e.g. for creating training and benchmarking data sets from published resources. These data can then be used for algorithms and machine learning methods.
